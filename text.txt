For billions of years, the moon and the sun co-existed in harmony.
It is what maintained the shaky balance between day and night; between light and darkness.
However, this equilibrium would soon falter and throw itself into utter chaos.
The moon was attacked by an asteroid belt and was blown up into countless pieces. 
Citizens of Earth were devastated; there would be no more night or darkness. 
Night clubs went out of business. 
The beauty of fireworks could not be seen. 
Skin cancer rates have sky-rocketed.

Among the many moon shards, one of them stood out.
He was not the biggest shard, nor the strongest.
But he had a burning passion to complete his goal: to reunite his people, the moon shards.
He goes by the name of Khaled.

Hi! My name is Khaled and this is my home-town: Lunar Drops.
This was the town that governed the stability of the moon.
However, the moon was blown up many years ago.
Many people tried to restore the moon but inevitably failed.
People began to lose hope and slowly moved out of Lunar Drops.
Today, I am the the last citizen of Lunar Drops.
It seems that I am the only moon-shard that has hope of restoring the moon.
The only way to restore the moon is to re-unify all the moon shards back in Lunar Drops.
Anyways, that's enough talk for now. I want to start my adventure.
I heard rumors that many of the moon-shards landed in Maokai Forest.
It's right beside Lunar Drops so it's the perfect place to start! Let's go!

This seems to be the right place.
It seems kind of spooky.
...
I see a lot of moon shards over there!
Let's go collect them!!!!!!!!
